SimpleBackup

See the file VERSION in this directory for version information.

This bash utility works on Debian-based distros and uses rsync to
backup your HOME directory to an external device labeled \"BACKUP\"
that is expected to be mounted under the username in the /media
directory. It ignores files in the same way CVS does. It runs in
archive mode with verbose output and compression.

If this is a beta release, you may find that the program is unfinished.
Even if it is a maintenance relase, you may encounter bugs. Please see
BUGS in this directory. If you do, please report them. Your bug reports
are valuable contributions to Positronikal since they allow us to
notice and fix problems on machines we don't have or in code we don't
use often.  See the file BUGS in this directory for more information on
how to report bugs.

Licensing information is contained in the file COPYING in this directory.
