Carnivore LE

See the file VERSION in this directory for version information.

Carnivore LE is a very fast forensic data gatherer to be used against
live (running) GNU/Linux (LIN), Macintosh (MAC), and Windows (WIN)
suspect computers to capture memory, user files, registry, logs, and
other volatile data that can be lost or rendered inaccessible once the
computer shuts down.

If this is a beta release, you may find that the program is unfinished.
Even if it is a maintenance relase, you may encounter bugs. Please see
BUGS in this directory. If you do, please report them. Your bug reports
are valuable contributions to Positronikal since they allow us to
notice and fix problems on machines we don't have or in code we don't
use often.  See the file BUGS in this directory for more information on
how to report bugs.

The software was built using Code::Blocks (http://www.codeblocks.org/).
Release binaries of LIN and MAC implementations were compiled/linked
using GNU GCC (https://gcc.gnu.org/) and the Windows implementation was
compiled/linked using MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/). All project files
necessary to edit, add to, or build same or custom binaries using these
tools are included in the repository specific to the implementation.
The file USING in this directory contains information for both
developers and practitioners. carnivore.cbp is the main project file.

Licensing information is contained in the file COPYING in this directory.
