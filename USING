BASIC INSTALLATION

This is a bash application, but should run on most current *NIX shells.
The only dependency is dialog, which is also available in the
repositories of most modern distributions.

Unzip the SimpleBackup download or navigate to the cloned directory,
depending on how you obtained the files from Github. Copy simplebu.sh
to the directory on your computer from which you intend to run it. One
recommendation is to create a ~/bin subdirectory, copy the script
there, and change the mode to execute:

  $ mkdir ~/bin \
  	&& 
  	&& cp [dir_location]simplebu.sh ~/bin \
  	&& chmod +x simplebu.sh

This can easily be accomplished from a file manager, i.e Nautilus,
Nemo, etc., as well. You may also want to add ~/bin to your path envar.

You'll need to attach an external device and mount the file system with
a label of "BACKUP". This will tpically be in

  /media/[user_name]/BACKUP

SimpleBackup will look for this location before running a backup and
error if not found.

To run, either open a terminal and run the following command as long as
~/bin is in your path variable:

  $ simplebu.sh

...or in a terminal opened in the bin directory:

  $ ./simplebu.sh

...or double-clicking backup.sh in a file manager and selecting "Run in
a terminal".

Once it initializes, a simple GUI interface will explain the program
and offer choices to run or abort. Everything is automatic from there.
If you ran it using either of the first two run options above, when
SimpleBackup finishes, it will return terminal control back to you. If
you ran it by clicking on it, the terminal will simply exit.
